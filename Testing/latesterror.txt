Your job needs a remote storage location on the remote host (Oakley).  If you need to create a new directory on OSC systems for this purpose, please log in and create it before continuing.
Enter the absolute path to a remote directory for job log output: /nfs/10/chrism/MATdir
Job "testjob" was successfully configured.
Would you like to launch your job now? (Y/N)y
Choose a number of MATLAB workers for your job (Max: 32)5

K>> help eval
 eval Execute string with MATLAB expression.
    eval(EXPRESSION) evaluates the MATLAB code in the string EXPRESSION.
 
    [OUTPUT1,...,OUTPUTN] = eval(EXPRESSION) returns output from EXPRESSION
    in the specified variables.
 
    Example: Interactively request the name of a matrix to plot.
 
       expression = input('Enter the name of a matrix: ','s');
       if (exist(expression,'var'))
          plot(eval(expression))
       end
